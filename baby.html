            <h2>ACNE Studios designs men and women ready-to-wear fashion, footwear, and accessories that are high quality and made-to-last. ACNE is a company that came from the art and creative world and the design of its fashion products draw from it’s artistic and creative history as well as its location, making for products that have a minimalistic and exploratory tone. The clothing is “edgy and slightly twisted, managing to walk a tightrope between slightly avant-garde and eminently wearable.”</h2>
            <h2>We built off of ACNE's current brand to create packaging for a new unisex fragrance from the company. We then organized and art directed a photoshoot for the advertising campaign that expressed the edgy, avant-garde and spirited tone of the packaging and brand.</h2>
