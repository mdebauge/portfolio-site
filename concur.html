            <h2>My role included collaborating on the user experience of the projects, creating UI for the web and mobile prototypes, and building microsites to showcase the projects.</h2>

With Share It, you share your Concur itinerary in one text message, and then book same or similar flights from there.</h5>

Instead of manually entering your report or receipts and trying to remember who came, you can quickly identify participants (or “attendees”) from your calendar event in one tap from your device. Accurate data goes to your Concur account, which double-checks for duplications, and there you have easy, instantaneous reporting.</h5>
