            <h2>Tape Op magazine is a music recording magazine that features in-depth interviews with musicians who have recorded their own albums as they talk about their recording process. Its audience includes DIY musicians, audio engineers and producers, as well as general music enthusiasts. </h2>
            <h2>With music and recording equipment costs getting more affordable combined with the added ease of creating and sharing music in the digital age, the magazine has become increasingly popular since so many musicians and music hobbyists are opting for the cheaper and more hands on approach of recording their own albums at home or in their own studio. This increased popularity gives the magazine the budget for a redesign with a distinct and artistic look and feel. The new identity for the magazine reflects it's new refined message: inspirational, intuitive, curious, and artistic. The redesigned 92 page issue and a matching responsive website build off of this new cultivated tone.</h2>
