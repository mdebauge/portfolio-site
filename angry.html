            <h2>From the soaring rise of student debt, to economic and healthcare concerns, right down to the drama of the politicians themselves, voters looking to elect this fall are unanimously angry. For most of us, distilling down this information to figure out the what, who, where, and why of the political season is daunting.</h2>
            <h2>Our challenge was to create an unbiased platform in which people searching for information regarding the election, could learn more about the voter demographics, who the key players are and what part they could play in changing the tide of the election. We produced an editorial style online presence that would help our users be able to better understand and engage with the information surrounding these angry voters and their potential going into the election.</h2>
